# git-project-simulation

A very small project to practice a real git workflow:
- Multiple small commits
- Clear commit messages
- Simple file structure

---

## Idea
A simple Python script that prints a greeting.  
The goal is to practice git, not to build a big app.

---

## What I Practice Here
- Creating and updating files step by step  
- Making small, meaningful commits  
- Viewing history with `git log`  
- Using branches if needed later
